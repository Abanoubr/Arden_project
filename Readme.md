Enhancing Data Processing and Handling with Chatbots and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This project is an initiative aimed at developing and testing chatbot models, specifically focusing on intent classification. This repository contains various resources, including intent data, test results, and python code K-fold cross-validation using IBM Watson.

Overview:
Arden-computing-project-dialog.json: This JSON file contains dialog configurations, possibly for a chatbot AI model. It includes various dialog nodes, conditions, and responses.

Intents: A directory containing CSV files with intent data. Each file represents a specific intent and contains examples of user inputs that map to that intent.

Tests: This directory contains CSV files with classification reports. These reports provide insights into the performance of the chatbot model across different test scenarios.

Watson Kfold: A section dedicated to K-fold cross-validation using IBM Watson. 

It includes:

controller: Contains Python scripts for managing credentials and IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS).
k-fold_test.py: A Python code that implements K-fold testing. It uses the Watson Assistant API to train and test the chatbot model across different folds of the data.
reference-code: Contains a Jupyter notebook and a Python code, both of which are related to K-fold cross-validation.
requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
